(<https://github.com/projectblacklight/spotlight>) to showcase digital
collection resources.

## Application Creation

See [docs/ApplicationCreation.md](docs/ApplicationCreation.md) for information
on how this application as generated with the "projectblacklight/spotlight"
Rails application generator.

## Local Development Environment

Instructions for building and running Spotlight locally can be found in
[docs/LocalDevelopmentEnvironment.md](docs/LocalDevelopmentEnvironment.md).

## Multi-item Uploads

## Building the Docker Images for K8s Deployment

The following procedure uses the Docker "buildx" functionality and the
Kubernetes "build" namespace to build the Docker images for use with the
"[umd-lib/k8s-spotlight][k8s-spotlight]" Kubernetes configuration. This
procedure should work on both "arm64" and "amd64" MacBooks.

The images will be automatically pushed to the Nexus.

### Local Machine Setup

See <https://github.com/umd-lib/k8s/blob/main/docs/DockerBuilds.md> in GitHub
for information about setting up a MacBook to use the Kubernetes "build"
namespace.

### Creating the Docker images

Creating the ‚Äúspotlight‚Äù Docker images for Kubernetes

1. In an empty directory, clone the Git repository and switch into the
   directory:

    ```zsh
    $ git clone git@github.com:umd-lib/spotlight.git
    $ cd spotlight
    ```

2. Checkout the appropriate Git tag, branch, or commit for the Docker image.

3. Set the `APP_TAG` environment variable:

    ```zsh
    $ export APP_TAG=<DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG>
    ```

   where \<DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG> is the Docker image tag to associate with the
   Docker image. This will typically be the Git tag for the application version,
   or some other identifier, such as a Git commit hash. For example, using
   the Git tag of "1.0.0":

    ```zsh
    $ export APP_TAG=1.0.0
    ```

4. Switch to the Kubernetes "build" namespace:

    ```zsh
    $ kubectl config use-context build
    ```

5. Build the Docker images using the Docker ‚Äúbuildx‚Äù tool:

    ```zsh
    $ docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 --builder=kube --push --no-cache -t docker.lib.umd.edu/spotlight:$APP_TAG -f Dockerfile .
    $ docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 --builder=kube --push --no-cache -t docker.lib.umd.edu/spotlight-solr:$APP_TAG -f Dockerfile.solr .
    ```

   The Docker images will be automatically pushed to the Nexus.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are used by the system when running in
Kubernetes. None of these variables are strictly necessary when running in the
local development environment:

* Email-related
  * `SERVER_HOSTNAME` - The hostname of the server. Used for generating links in
    the body of emails sent by the system.
  * `SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS` - The email address to use as the "From:" email address
  * `SMTP_ADDRESS` - hostname of the SMTP server
  * `SMTP_PORT` - port of the SMTP server
  * Other environment variables (`SMTP_DOMAIN`, `SMTP_USER_NAME`,
    `SMTP_PASSWORD`, and `SMTP_AUTHENTICATION`) are not typically needed.
* Database-related (for Postgres, in production)
  * `PROD_DATABASE_ADAPTER` - The database adapter for production, typically
    "postgresql"
  * `PROD_DATABASE_NAME` - The name of the database, typically "spotlight"
  * `PROD_DATABASE_ENCODING` - the database encoding, typically "utf-8"
  * `PROD_DATABASE_USERNAME` - the username for the database, typically
    "spotlight"
  * `PROD_DATABASE_PASSWORD` - the password for the database user
  * `PROD_DATABASE_HOST` - The hostname of the database
  * `PROD_DATABASE_PORT` - The port the database runs on, typically "5432" for
     Postgres
  * `PROD_DATABASE_POOL` - The size of the database pool, typically "10"
