# Multi-item Uploads

## Introduction

This document describes how to perform multi-item uploads in Spotlight,
expanding on the information provided in the "Creating multiple items from a
spreadsheet" section of the Spotlight wiki
(<https://github.com/projectblacklight/spotlight/wiki/Resource-Scenarios#creating-multiple-items-from-a-spreadsheet>).

## CSV File

A template CSV file can be obtained via the "Download Template" link on the
"Upload multiple items" tab when adding an item.

The [docs/resources/solar_system_multi-item_upload.csv](resources/solar_system_multi-item_upload.csv)
contains a sample multi-item CSV file described objects in the Solar System,
using images from Wikipedia.
